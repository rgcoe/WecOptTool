    "Since the flywheel is protected from wave loading by the buoy, it is **not** subject to hydrostatics or hydrodynamics.\n",
    "* **Spring**: The magnetic torsional spring provides positive stiffness to the flywheel.\n",
    "It has a linear displacement up to 45 degrees, at which point it \"wraps around\" and the stiffness begins decreasing.\n",
    "For simplicity, we will model the spring as strictly linear.\n",

    "In order to determine a suitable frequency range, it is best to complete an optimization with a large frequency range and examine the frequency domain results to see how large a range of frequencies is necessary to capture the relavent dynamics.\n",
    "Often, capturing nonlinear dynamics (such as due to constraints) requires a larger frequency range.\n",
    "In the case of the Pioneer WEC, it is clear that (likely due to the PTO torque constraint) the nonlinearities cause excitation at the odd harmonics of the excited frequency (which is slightly larger than the wave frequency itself for the Pioneer system).\n",
    "Specifically, the PTO force has significant peaks around the excited frequency and at the 3rd harmonic (with a small peak at the 5th harmonic as well) which leads to peaks in the frequency spectrum of electrical power at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th harmonics.\n",
    "The frequency values are normalized in the plots below to more clearly show the harmonics.\n",
    "In order to capture most of these nonlinearities, we chose a frequency range from 0 to 1.875 for this tutorial. "
